Land and underutilized facilities are often one of universities' most valuable assets, but require thoughtful plans as these institutions are also often closely connected to their communities. Focused on smaller institutions and those targeting underrepresented students (HBCUs, HBIs, etc.) this session explores strategies to leverage land and other assets to advance the mission of the institution, support it financially, or provide community benefit. Attendees will be able to apply lessons learned from other institutions to their edge- and off- campus assets as they consider potential partnerships for real estate development at underutilized land and facilities, considering the overall impact to their missional objectives. Importantly, speakers will discuss pitfalls to avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This panel will outline how universities can meet their sustainability goals (such as alternative energy and carbon neutrality), which often have significant costs, by unlocking the value their existing parking assets. The discussion will include the types of energy and sustainability solutions (e.g. solar, storage, geothermal, etc.) can be utilized by universities and how a parking monetization can assist universities with a transition to net zero decarbonization and not only help provide the funding, but also be responsible for the delivery and maintenance of these technologies. The panel will uncover what a monetization P3 looks like with a distinct approach, utilizing an all-tax-exempt debt structure without the complications of an equity investor, lessons learned spanning procurement through implementation, benefits beyond the initial capital infusion which include supporting not only sustainability goals, but also social goals, such as how the parking system serves students, faculty, staff, and visitors).

This frequently includes the addition of a mix of uses adjacent to the facility to provide a vibrant guest experience that additionally provides an opportunity for the University to better engage the communities in which they are located and for further advancing other strategic priorities.  These compelling districts also provide opportunities to enter into agreements with the public sector that will allow for public investment and additionally provide opportunities for the introduction of private capital as well. Each of the panelists is embarking on transformative projects for their university and will discuss the similarities, but more importantly the differences in not only the nature of the project, but the approach to delivering the project – each of which is reflective of the unique culture and traditions of some of the most iconic institutions in the nation.

We will feature different perspectives from the key project partners and the institution, appealing to owners, designers, developers, and contractors. The panel will equip campus constituents with specific strategies as they develop their P3 framework. We will share information from a recent, multi-phase, multi-site P3 delivered in one of the most challenging construction markets in decades. Attendees will be more informed on how to help their institutions consider implementing this strategic approach to adding student housing while keeping debt off their balance sheets. Key members will give candid feedback on how this alternative delivery method creates efficiencies in the schedule and demonstrate speed to delivery.

Higher education has a long history of employee housing; however, today’s issues require updated tools and strategies. This roundtable will include an introduction to the market fundamentals of workforce housing, key risk and administrative areas in which differs from student housing experiences, and P3 solutions that have recently moved forward in the US and the tools they used to do so. JLL Table 2: Best Practices in Executing and Managing Physical Security Programs in Higher Education The roundtable will provide insights to leading physical security concepts that are providing best practices in safety and security at higher ed campuses. This will include use of technologies, people and process. We will discuss how security stakeholders navigate prevelant security challenges, how they navigate funding and procurement, what leading technologies are proving to be effective in mitigating risks, and how best pratices help develop sustainable security programs across their campuses. Atriade Table 3: Everything is On Credit – Addressing the Fear of the Unknown When deciding on whether a P3 is the right approach for their capital projects, universities inevitably will need to address the impact of the project on their credit.  When being told that “everything is on credit,” universities often question the value of a P3, when the appropriate question may be “how will the project impact the university’s credit.”  In this roundtable discussion, RBC Capital Markets will present the results of a deep dive into the credit performance of student housing over the years and how these projects impacted the credit of the sponsor universities as we assess an overarching question: “If everything is on credit, why haven’t there been more downgrades?” RBC Capital Markets Table 4: Executing on an Energy Master Plan with a P3 Harrison Street and its partners have assisted universities with master planning efforts in support of energy P3 engagements. This process allows the P3 to enable long identified projects to come to fruition, including a fulsome decarbonization and energy resilience strategy. This rountablewill discuss key features of a sample P3 along with potential roadmaps the team has used to identify decarbonization and energy resiliency projects and the appropriate size and timing and technologies for those initiatives.

The discussion will cover the benefits of transferring O&M responsibilities to the private sector, the associated risks, and how to best manage those risks.  The panelists will also explore strategies that higher education institutions and their private partners can employ to ensure that the transferred O&M services are aligned with the owner’s objectives, appropriately scoped to take into consideration any labor issues, and performed to contractually specified standards throughout the term.

Combined, the hotels represent 523 keys, four restaurants, and nearly 80,000 square feet of meeting space. The agreement between the university and the private partner (“Scholar” Hotel Group) required Scholar to make significant reinvestment into both properties, including a gut-renovation of the Nittany Lion Inn which is reopening August 2024.
