“Hey Siri – How do I Implement a P3 on Our Campus?” How to Prepare for Your Institution's First P3
Whether it’s for housing, infrastructure, or any other mission critical function, implementing your first P3 can be a challenging and often confusing process. Unfortunately, there is no voice-activated AI option for helping higher-ed institutions navigate through the evaluation of the opportunity and the procurement of a development partner. Through a diverse panel of campus leaders and P3 partners (advisory, development and design) this panel detail various procurement methods and selection criteria that will lead to a successful implementation and long-term relationship. This interactive discussion will include real-life campus scenarios that will help you understand the advantages and potential risks to consider as your institution prepare for this important commitment.

Generating Diverse Revenue Streams (and Avoiding Others' Mistakes)
Many small, mid-sized, and specialty institutions are under-resourced, requiring creative revenue generation strategies. Land and underutilized facilities are often one of universities' most valuable assets, but require thoughtful plans as these institutions are also often closely connected to their communities. Focused on smaller institutions and those targeting underrepresented students (HBCUs, HBIs, etc.) this session explores strategies to leverage land and other assets to advance the mission of the institution, support it financially, or provide community benefit. Attendees will be able to apply lessons learned from other institutions to their edge- and off- campus assets as they consider potential partnerships for real estate development at underutilized land and facilities, considering the overall impact to their missional objectives. Importantly, speakers will discuss pitfalls to avoid.

1:45 pm — 2:30 pm
Achieving Sustainability Goals through a Parking Monetization – Innovative Balance Sheet Support with Potential Sustainability and Social Benefits
Tens of millions of dollars are being unlocked from campus parking systems through long-term lease and concession agreements.

This panel will outline how universities can meet their sustainability goals (such as alternative energy and carbon neutrality), which often have significant costs, by unlocking the value their existing parking assets. The discussion will include the types of energy and sustainability solutions (e.g. solar, storage, geothermal, etc.) can be utilized by universities and how a parking monetization can assist universities with a transition to net zero decarbonization and not only help provide the funding, but also be responsible for the delivery and maintenance of these technologies. The panel will uncover what a monetization P3 looks like with a distinct approach, utilizing an all-tax-exempt debt structure without the complications of an equity investor, lessons learned spanning procurement through implementation, benefits beyond the initial capital infusion which include supporting not only sustainability goals, but also social goals, such as how the parking system serves students, faculty, staff, and visitors).

Sports-Anchored Mixed-Use Districts: Universities Blazing a Trail
Universities are facing the need to modernize or rebuild their aging stadiums, arenas, and performance venues and now recognize the importance and value in providing an elevated experience for their students, alumni and fans.  This frequently includes the addition of a mix of uses adjacent to the facility to provide a vibrant guest experience that additionally provides an opportunity for the University to better engage the communities in which they are located and for further advancing other strategic priorities.  These compelling districts also provide opportunities to enter into agreements with the public sector that will allow for public investment and additionally provide opportunities for the introduction of private capital as well.

Each of the panelists is embarking on transformative projects for their university and will discuss the similarities, but more importantly the differences in not only the nature of the project, but the approach to delivering the project – each of which is reflective of the unique culture and traditions of some of the most iconic institutions in the nation.

Key Lessons Learned on Completed P3 Student Housing and Amenities
P3s can capture value not available in traditional delivery models.  We will feature different perspectives from the key project partners and the institution, appealing to owners, designers, developers, and contractors. The panel will equip campus constituents with specific strategies as they develop their P3 framework.

We will share information from a recent, multi-phase, multi-site P3 delivered in one of the most challenging construction markets in decades. Attendees will be more informed on how to help their institutions consider implementing this strategic approach to adding student housing while keeping debt off their balance sheets. Key members will give candid feedback on how this alternative delivery method creates efficiencies in the schedule and demonstrate speed to delivery.

Roundtables
Table 1: The Re-emergence of University Workforce Housing: Drivers, Tools, and Solutions
With the increasing cost of housing in the United States, many universities are combatting issues of affordability for their own faculty and staff. Higher education has a long history of employee housing; however, today’s issues require updated tools and strategies. This roundtable will include an introduction to the market fundamentals of workforce housing, key risk and administrative areas in which differs from student housing experiences, and P3 solutions that have recently moved forward in the US and the tools they used to do so.

Table 2: Best Practices in Executing and Managing Physical Security Programs in Higher Education
The roundtable will provide insights to leading physical security concepts that are providing best practices in safety and security at higher ed campuses. This will include use of technologies, people and process. We will discuss how security stakeholders navigate prevelant security challenges, how they navigate funding and procurement, what leading technologies are proving to be effective in mitigating risks, and how best pratices help develop sustainable security programs across their campuses.

Table 3: Everything is On Credit – Addressing the Fear of the Unknown
When deciding on whether a P3 is the right approach for their capital projects, universities inevitably will need to address the impact of the project on their credit.  When being told that “everything is on credit,” universities often question the value of a P3, when the appropriate question may be “how will the project impact the university’s credit.”  In this roundtable discussion, RBC Capital Markets will present the results of a deep dive into the credit performance of student housing over the years and how these projects impacted the credit of the sponsor universities as we assess an overarching question: “If everything is on credit, why haven’t there been more downgrades?”

Campus Energy P3s Do Not All Need to Look Alike
Campus Energy P3’s do not all need to look alike (and probably shouldn’t). This panel is focused on structuring need focused campus energy P3s and will include a discussion about the various models including: privatization and upfront payments, greenfield focused initiatives and hybrid structures. The conversation will include a discussion of three unique energy P3s with the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and Appalachian State University.

Lessons Learned Post-closing: Penn State University – Hospitality Projects
Potomac Ballroom Salon 3
Pennsylvania State University executed the largest hospitality public-private partnership in history for their two on-campus university-owned and operated hotels. Combined, the hotels represent 523 keys, four restaurants, and nearly 80,000 square feet of meeting space. The agreement between the university and the private partner (“Scholar” Hotel Group) required Scholar to make significant reinvestment into both properties, including a gut-renovation of the Nittany Lion Inn which is reopening August 2024. The panel will explore lessons learned and best practices from the transaction and include representatives from the university, Scholar, and the university’s advisor (RJA).
