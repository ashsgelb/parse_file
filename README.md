Task: 
    Go through the agenda and put it into a spreadsheet with catagroies for Day, Time, Title, and Details

Idea: 
    Instead of tediously copy and pasting, write a python script that can generate this spreadsheet. Use the formatting given on the website (https://www.p3highereducation.com/agenda/)

Implementation: 

    1. Parse the code based off of formatting given on the website (https://www.p3highereducation.com/agenda/)

    2. Have it print to prettytables (easy way to debug while coding)

    3. Create another file using same code basis that uses pandas to allow export to an excel file

Example Files (took text from website):

    1. sunday.txt

    2. monday.txt

    3. tuesday.txt

Pretty Table Output:

    1. Sunday_table -- showing only events on Sunday

    2. Monday_table -- showing only events on Monday

    3. Tuesday_table -- showing only events on Tuesday

    4. All_table -- show events for all three days

Excel Output:
    1. Sunday_excel -- showing only events on Sunday

    2. Monday_excel -- showing only events on Monday

    3. Tuesday_excel -- showing only events on Tuesday
    
    4. All_excel -- show events for all three days
