Task: Go through the agenda and put it into a spreadsheet with catagroies for Day, Time, Title, and Details

Idea: Instead of copy and pasting for an hour, write a python script that can do it for me

Implementation: 
    1. Have it print to prettytables (easy way to debug while coding)
    2. Create another file using same code basis that uses pandas to make into excel file
